<p>In order that tests may be intelligently compared, it is important that account be taken of the speed at which the stress was applied. In determining the basis for a ratio between time and strength the rate of strain, which is controllable, and not the ratio of stress, which is circumstantial, should be used. In other words, the rate at which the movable head of the testing machine descends and not the rate of increase in the load is to be regulated. This ratio, to which the name <i>speed-strength modulus</i> has been given, may be expressed as a coefficient which, if multiplied into any proportional change in speed, will give the proportional change in strength. This ratio is derived from empirical curves. (<a href="h-5.xhtml#TABLE_17" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">See Table XVII</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00053">BENDING LARGE BEAMS</h3><p class="ctr"><img src="ask.png" alt="*" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}img"/></p>
<p><i>Apparatus</i>: A static bending machine (described above), with a special crosshead for third-point loading and a long platform bearing knife-edge supports, is required. (<a href="h-5.xhtml#fig29" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">See Fig. 29</a>.)</p>
<p class="ctr"><img src="fig29.jpg" alt="Figure 29" id="fig29" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}img"/></p>
<p class="imgtitle">Figure 29</p>
<p class="imgtext">Static bending test on large beam. Note arrangement of wire and scale for measuring deflection; also method of applying load at "third-points."</p>
<p><i>Preparing the material</i>: Standard sizes and grades of beams and timbers in common use are employed. The ends are roughly squared and the specimen weighed and measured, taking the cross-sectional dimensions midway of the length. Weights should be to the nearest pound, lengths to the nearest 0.1 inch, and cross-sectional dimensions to the nearest 0.01 inch.</p>
<p><i>Marking and sketching</i>: The butt end of the beam is marked <a id="pg095"/> <i>A</i> and the top end <i>B</i>. While facing <i>A</i>, the top side is marked <i>a</i>, the right hand <i>b</i>, the bottom <i>c</i>, the left hand <i>d</i>. Sketches are made of each side and end, showing (1) size, location, and condition of knots, checks, splits, and other defects; (2) irregularities of grain; (3) distribution of heartwood and sapwood; and on the ends: (4) the location of the pith and the arrangement of the growth rings, (5) number of rings per inch, and (6) the proportion of late wood.</p>
<p>The number of rings per inch and the proportion of late wood should always be determined along a radius or a line normal to the rings. The average number of rings per inch is the total number of rings divided by the length of the line crossing them. The proportion of late wood is equal to the sum of the widths of the late wood crossed by the line, divided by the length of the line. Rings per inch should be to the nearest 0.1; late wood to the nearest 0.1 per cent.</p>
<p>Since in large beams a great variation in rate of growth and <a id="pg096"/> relative amount of late wood is likely in different parts of the section, it is advisable to consider the cross section in three volumes, namely, the upper and lower quarters and the middle half. The determination should be made upon each volume separately, and the average for the entire cross section obtained from these results.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the test the failure, as it appears on each surface, is traced on the sketches, with the failures numbered in the order of their occurrence. If the beam is subsequently cut up and used for other tests an additional sketch may be desirable to show the location of each piece.</p>
<p><i>Adjusting specimen in machine</i>: The beam is placed in the machine with the side marked <i>a</i> on top, and with the ends projecting equally beyond the supports. In order to prevent crushing of the fibre at the points where the stress is applied it is necessary to use bearing blocks of maple or other hard wood with a convex surface in contact with the beam. Roller bearings should be placed between the bearing blocks and the knife edges of the crosshead to allow for the shortening due to flexure. (<a href="h-5.xhtml#fig29" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">See Fig. 29</a>.) Third-point loading is used, that is, the load is applied at two points one-third the span of the beam apart. (<a href="h-5.xhtml#fig30" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">See Fig. 30</a>.) This affords a uniform bending moment throughout the central third of the beam.</p>
<p class="ctr"><img src="fig30.jpg" alt="Figure 30" id="fig30" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}img"/></p>
<p class="imgtitle">Figure 30</p>
<p class="imgtext">Two methods of loading a beam, namely, third-point loading (upper), and centre loading (lower).</p>
<p><i>Measuring the deflection</i>: The method of measuring the deflection should be such that any compression at the points of support or at the application of the load will not affect the reading. This may be accomplished by driving a small nail near each end of the beam, the exact location being on the neutral plane and vertically above each knife-edge support. Between these nails a fine wire is stretched free of the beam and kept taut by means of a rubber band or coiled spring on one end. Behind the wire at a point on the beam midway between the supports a steel scale graduated to hundredths of an inch is fastened vertically by means of thumb-tacks or small screws passing through holes in it. Attachment should be made on the neutral plane.</p>
<p>The first reading is made when the scale beam is balanced at zero load, and afterward at regular increments of the load which is applied continuously and at a uniform speed. (See Speed of <a id="pg097"/> Testing Machine, <a href="h-4.xhtml#pg092" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">page 92</a>.) If desired, however, the load may be read at regular increments of deflection. The deflection readings should be to the nearest 0.01 inch. To avoid error due to parallax, the readings may be taken by means of a reading telescope about ten feet distant and approximately on a level with the wire. A mirror fastened to the scale will increase the accuracy of the readings if the telescope is not used. As in all tests on timber, the strain must be continuous to rupture, not intermittent, and readings must be taken "on the fly." The weighing beam is kept balanced after the yield point is reached and the maximum load, and at least one point beyond it, noted.</p>
<p><i>Log of the test</i>: The proper log sheet for this test consists of a piece of cross-section paper with space at the margin for notes. (<a href="h-5.xhtml#fig32" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">See Fig. 32</a>.) The load in some convenient unit (1,000 to 10,000 pounds, depending upon the dimensions of the specimen) is entered on the ordinates, the deflection in tenths of an inch on the abscissæ. The increments of load should be chosen so as to <a id="pg098"/> furnish about ten points on the stress-strain diagram below the elastic limit.</p>
<p>As the readings of the wire on the scale are made they are entered directly in their proper place on the cross-section paper. In many cases a test should be continued until complete failure results. The points where the various failures occur are indicated on the stress-strain diagram. A brief description of the failure is made on the margin of the log sheet, and the form traced on the sketches.</p>
<p><i>Disposal of the specimen</i>: Two one-inch sections are cut from the region of failure to be used in determining the moisture content. (<a href="h-4.xhtml#III_04" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">See Moisture Determination, page 90</a>.) A two-inch section may be cut for subsequent reference and identification, and possible microscopic study. The remainder of the beam may be cut into small beams and compression pieces.</p>
<p><i>Calculating the results</i>: The formulæ used in calculating the results of tests on large rectangular simple beams loaded at third points of the span are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00054">BENDING SMALL BEAMS</h3>
<p><i>Apparatus</i>: An ordinary static bending machine, a steel I-beam bearing two adjustable knife-edge supports to rest on the platform, and a special deflectometer, are required. (<a href="h-5.xhtml#fig31" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">See Fig. 31</a>.)</p>
<p class="ctr"><img src="fig31.jpg" alt="Figure 31" id="fig31" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}img"/></p>
<p class="imgtitle">Figure 31</p>
<p class="imgtext">Static bending test on small beam. Note the use of the deflectometer with indicator and dial for measuring the deflection; also roller bearings between beam and supports.</p>
<p><i>Preparing the material</i>: The specimens may be of any convenient size, though beams 2" × 2" × 30" tested over a 28-inch span, are considered best. The beams are surfaced on all four sides, care being taken that they are not damaged by the rollers of the surfacing machine. Material for these tests is sometimes cut from large beams after failure. The specimens are carefully weighed in grams, and all dimensions measured to the nearest 0.01 inch. If to be tested in a green or fresh condition the <a id="pg100"/> specimens should be kept in a damp box or covered with moist sawdust until needed. No defects should be allowed in these specimens.</p>
<p><i>Marking and sketching</i>: Sketches are made of each end of the specimen to show the character of the growth, and after testing, the manner of failure is shown for all four sides. In obtaining data regarding the rate of growth and the proportion of late wood the same procedure is followed as with large beams.</p>
<p><i>Adjusting specimen in machine</i>: The beam should be correctly centred in the machine and each end should have a plate with roller bearings between it and the support. Centre loading is used. Between the movable head of the machine and the specimen is placed a bearing block of maple or other hard wood, the lower surface of which is curved in a direction along the beam, the curvature of which should be slightly less than that of the beam at rupture, in order to prevent the edges from crushing into the fibres of the test piece.</p>
<p><i>Measuring the deflection</i>: The method of measuring deflection of large beams can be used for small sizes, but because of the shortness of the span and consequent slight deformation in the latter, it is hardly accurate enough for good work. The special deflectometer shown in Fig. 31 allows closer reading, as it magnifies the deflection ten times. It rests on two small nails driven in the beam on the neutral plane and vertically above the supports. The fine wire on the wheel at the base of the indicator is attached to another small nail driven in the beam on the neutral plane midway between the end nails. All three nails should be in place before the beam is put into the machine. The indicator is adjustable by means of a thumb-screw at the base and is set at zero before the load is applied. Deflections are read to the nearest 0.001 inch. For rate of application of load see Speed of Testing Machine, <a href="h-4.xhtml#pg092" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">page 92</a>. The speed should be uniform from start to finish without stopping. Readings must be made "on the fly."</p>
<p><i>Log of the test</i>: The log sheets used for small beams (see Fig. 32) are the same as for large sizes and the procedure is practically identical. The stress-strain diagram is continued to or beyond the maximum load, and in a portion of the tests should be continued to six-inch deflection or until the specimen fails to support a load of 200 pounds. Deflection readings for equal increments of <a id="pg102"/> load are taken until well beyond the elastic limit, after which the scale beam is kept balanced and the load read for each 0.1 inch deflection. The load and deflection at first failure, the maximum load, and any points of sudden change should be shown on the diagram, even though they do not occur at one of the regular points. A brief description of the failure and the nature of any defects is entered on the log sheet.</p>

<p><i>Apparatus</i>: An ordinary static testing machine and a compressometer are required. (<a href="h-5.xhtml#fig33" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">See Fig. 33</a>.)</p>

<p class="imgtitle">Figure 33</p>
<p class="imgtext">Endwise compression test, showing method of measuring the deformation by means of a compressometer.</p>
<p><i>Preparing the material</i>: Two classes of specimens are commonly used, namely, (1) posts 24 &#x201D; in length, and (2) small clear blocks approximately 2&#x201D; × 2&#x201D; × 8&#x201D;. The specimens are surfaced on all four sides and both ends squared smoothly and evenly. They are carefully weighed, measured, rate of growth and proportion of late wood determined, as in bending tests. After the test a moisture section is cut and weighed. Ordinarily these specimens should be free from defects.</p>
<p><i>Sketching</i>: Sketches are made of each end of the specimens to show the character of the growth. After testing, the manner of failure is shown for all four sides, and the various parts of the failure are numbered in the order of their occurrence.</p>
<p><i>Adjusting specimen in machine</i>: The compressometer collars are adjusted, the distance between them being 20 inches for the posts and 6 inches for the blocks. If the two ends of the blocks are not exactly parallel a ball-and-socket block can be placed between <a id="pg103"/> the upper end of the specimen and the movable head of the machine to overcome the irregularity. If the blocks are true they can simply be stood on end upon the platform and the movable head allowed to press directly upon the upper end.</p>
<p><i>Measuring the deformation</i>: The deformation is measured by a compressometer. (<a href="h-5.xhtml#fig33" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">See Fig. 33</a>.) The latter registers to 0.001 inch. In the case of posts the compression between the collars is communicated to the four points on the arms by means of brass rods; with short blocks, as in <a href="h-5.xhtml#fig33" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Fig. 33</a>, the points of the arms are in direct contact with the collars. The operator lowers the fulcrum of the apparatus by moving the micrometer screws at such a rate that the set-screw in the rear end of the upper lever is kept barely touching the fixed arm below it, being guided by a bell operated by electric contact.</p>
<p><i>Log of the test</i>: The load is applied continuously at a uniform rate of speed. (See Speed of Testing Maching, <a href="h-4.xhtml#pg092" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">page 92</a>.) <a id="pg104"/> Readings are taken from the scale of the compressometer at regular increments of either load or compression. The stress-strain diagram is continued to at least one deformation point beyond the maximum load, and in event of sudden failure, the direction of the curve beyond the maximum point is indicated. A brief description of the failure is entered on the log sheet. (<a href="h-5.xhtml#fig34" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">See Fig. 34</a>.)</p>

<p>In short specimens the failure usually occurs in one or several planes diagonal to the axis of the specimen. If the ends are more moist than the middle a crushing may occur on the extreme ends in a horizontal plane. Such a test is not valid and should always be culled. If the grain is diagonal or the stress is unevenly applied a diagonal shear may occur from top to bottom of the test specimen. Such tests are also invalid and should be culled. When the plane (or several planes) of failure occurs through the body of the specimen the test is valid. It may sometimes be advantageous to allow the extreme ends to dry slightly before testing in order to bring the planes of failure within the body. This is a perfectly legitimate procedure provided no drying is allowed from the sides of the specimen, and the moisture disk is cut from the region of failure.</p>
