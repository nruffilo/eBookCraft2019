<h3 id="pgepubid00014">TENSILE STRENGTH</h3>
<p><b>Tension</b> results when a pulling force is applied to opposite ends of a body. This external pull is communicated to the interior, so that any portion of the material exerts a pull or tensile force upon the remainder, the ability to do so depending upon the property of cohesion. The result is an elongation or stretching of the material in the direction of the applied force. The action is the opposite of compression.</p>
<p>Wood exhibits its greatest strength in tension parallel to the grain, and it is very uncommon in practice for a specimen to be pulled in two lengthwise. This is due to the difficulty of making the end fastenings secure enough for the full tensile strength to be brought into play before the fastenings shear off longitudinally. This is not the case with metals, and as a result they are used in almost all places where tensile strength is particularly needed, even though the remainder of the structure, such as sills, beams, joists, posts, and flooring, may be of wood. Thus in a wooden truss bridge the tension members are steel rods.</p>
<p><a id="pg008"/></p>
<p>The tensile strength of wood parallel to the grain depends upon the strength of the fibres and is affected not only by the nature and dimensions of the wood elements but also by their arrangement. It is greatest in straight-grained specimens with thick-walled fibres. Cross grain of any kind materially reduces the tensile strength of wood, since the tensile strength at right angles to the grain is only a small fraction of that parallel to the grain.</p>

<p>Failure of wood in tension parallel to the grain occurs sometimes in flexure, especially with dry material. The tension portion of the fracture is nearly the same as though the piece were pulled in two lengthwise. The fibre walls are torn across obliquely and usually in a spiral direction. There is practically no pulling apart of the fibres, that is, no separation of the fibres along their walls, regardless of their thickness. The nature of tension failure is apparently not affected by the moisture condition of the specimen, at least not so much so as the other strength values.<a id="fn03r"/><div style="display:inline-block;" class="pginternal"/></p>
<p>Tension at right angles to the grain is closely related to cleavability. When wood fails in this manner the thin fibre walls are torn in two lengthwise while the thick-walled fibres are usually pulled apart along the primary wall.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00015">COMPRESSIVE OR CRUSHING STRENGTH</h3>
<p class="ctr"><img src="ask.png" alt="*"/></p>
<p><b>Compression across the grain</b> is very closely related to hardness and transverse shear. There are two ways in which wood is subjected to stress of this kind, namely, (1) with the load acting over the entire area of the specimen, and (2) with a load concentrated over a portion of the area. (<a href="h-1.xhtml#fig02" class="pginternal">See Fig. 2</a>.) The latter is the condition more commonly met with in practice, as, for example, where a post rests on a horizontal sill, or a rail rests on a cross-tie. The former condition, however, gives the true resistance of the grain to simple crushing.]</p>
<p class="ctr"><img src="fig02.jpg" alt="Figure 2" id="fig02"/></p>
<p class="imgtitle">Figure 2</p>
<p class="imgtext">Compression across the grain.</p>
<p><a id="pg010"/></p>
<p>The first effect of compression across the grain is to compact the fibres, the load gradually but irregularly increasing as the density of the material is increased. If the specimen lies on a flat surface and the load is applied to only a portion of the upper area, the bearing plate indents the wood, crushing the upper fibres without affecting the lower part. (<a href="h-1.xhtml#fig03" class="pginternal">See Fig. 3</a>.) As the load increases the projecting ends sometimes split horizontally. (<a href="h-1.xhtml#fig04" class="pginternal">See Fig. 4</a>.) The irregularities in the load are due to the fact that the fibres collapse a few at a time, beginning with those with the thinnest walls. The projection <a id="pg012"/> of the ends increases the strength of the material directly beneath the compressing weight by introducing a beam action which helps support the load. This influence is exerted for a short distance only.</p>

<p>When wood is used for columns, props, posts, and spokes, the weight of the load tends to shorten the material endwise. This is <b>endwise compression</b>, or compression parallel to the grain. In the case of long columns, that is, pieces in which the length is very great compared with their diameter, the failure is by sidewise bending or flexure, instead of by crushing or splitting. (<a href="h-1.xhtml#fig05" class="pginternal">See Fig. 5</a>.) A familiar instance of this action is afforded by a flexible walking-stick. If downward pressure is exerted with the hand on the upper end of the stick placed vertically on the floor, it will be noted that a definite amount of force must be applied in each instance before decided flexure takes place. After this point is reached a very slight increase of pressure very largely increases the deflection, thus obtaining so great a leverage about the middle section as to cause rupture.</p>
<p><a id="pg011"/></p>
<p class="ctr"><img src="fig05.jpg" alt="Figure 5" id="fig05"/></p>
<p class="imgtitle">Figure 5</p>
<p class="imgtext">Testing a buggy spoke in endwise compression, illustrating the failure by sidewise bending of a long column fixed only at the lower end. <i>Photo by U. S. Forest Service</i></p>
<p>The lateral bending of a column produces a combination of bending with compressive stress over the section, the compressive stress being maximum at the section of greatest deflection on the concave side. The convex surface is under tension, as in an ordinary beam test. (<a href="h-1.xhtml#fig06" class="pginternal">See Fig. 6</a>.) If the same stick is braced in such a way that flexure is prevented, its supporting strength is increased enormously, since the compressive stress acts uniformly over the section, and failure is by crushing or splitting, as in small blocks. In all columns free to bend in any direction the deflection will be seen in the direction in which the column is least stiff. This sidewise bending can be overcome by making pillars and columns thicker in the middle than at the ends, and by bracing studding, props, and compression <a id="pg014"/> members of trusses. The strength of a column also depends to a considerable extent upon whether the ends are free to turn or are fixed.</p>

<p class="imgtitle">Figure 6</p>
<p class="imgtext">Unequal distribution of stress in a long column due to lateral bending.</p>
<p>The complexity of the computations depends upon the way in which the stress is applied and the manner in which the stick bends. Ordinarily where the length of the test specimen is not greater than four diameters and the ends are squarely faced (<a href="h-1.xhtml#fig07" class="pginternal">See Fig. 7</a>.), the force acts uniformly over each square inch of area and the crushing strength is equal to the maximum load (<i>P</i>) divided by the area of the cross-section (<i>A</i>).</p>

<p class="imgtext">Endwise compression of a short column.</p>
<p>It has been demonstrated<a id="fn04r"/><div style="display:inline-block;" class="pginternal"/> that the ultimate strength in compression parallel to the grain is very nearly the same as the extreme <a id="pg015"/> fibre stress at the elastic limit in bending. (<a href="h-1.xhtml#TABLE_05" class="pginternal">See Table 5</a>.) In other words, the transverse strength of beams at elastic limit is practically equal to the compressive strength of the same material in short columns. It is accordingly possible to calculate the approximate breaking strength of beams from the compressive strength of short columns except when the wood is brittle. Since tests on endwise compression are simpler, easier to make, and less expensive than transverse bending tests, the importance of this relation is obvious, though it does not do away with the necessity of making beam tests.</p>

<p>The first is typical of any dry thin-walled cells, as is usually the case in seasoned white pine and spruce, and in the early wood of hard pines, hemlock, and other species with decided contrast between the two portions of the growth ring. As a rule buckling of a tracheid begins at the bordered pits which form places of least resistance in the walls. In hardwoods such as oak, chestnut, ash, etc., buckling occurs only in the thinnest-walled elements, such as the vessels, and not in the true fibres.</p>
<p>According to Jaccard<a id="fn06r"/><div style="display:inline-block;" class="pginternal"/> the folding of the cells is accompanied by characteristic alterations of their walls which seem to split them into extremely thin layers. When greatly magnified, these layers appear in longitudinal sections as delicate threads without <a id="pg017"/> any definite arrangements, while on cross section they appear as numerous concentric strata. This may be explained on the ground that the growth of a fibre is by successive layers which, under the influence of compression, are sheared apart. This is particularly the case with thick-walled cells such as are found in late wood.</p>

<p>The second case, where the fibres bend with more or less regular curves instead of buckling, is characteristic of any green or wet wood, and in dry woods where the fibres are thick-walled. In woods in which the fibre walls show all gradations of thickness—in other words, where the transition from the thin-walled cells of the early wood to the thick-walled cells of the late wood is gradual—the two kinds of failure, namely, buckling and bending, grade into each other. In woods with very decided contrast between early and late wood the two forms are usually distinct. Except in the case of complete failure the cavity of the deformed cells remains open, and in hardwoods this is true not only of the wood fibres but also of the tube-like vessels. In many cases longitudinal splits occur which isolate bundles of elements by greater or less intervals. The splitting occurs by a tearing of the fibres or rays and not by the separation of the rays from the adjacent elements.</p>

<p class="imgtext">Failures of short columns of dry chestnut.</p>
<p>Moisture in wood decreases the stiffness of the fibre walls and enlarges the region of failure. The curve which the fibre walls <a id="pg018"/> make in the region of failure is more gradual and also more irregular than in dry wood, and the fibres are more likely to be separated.</p>
<p>In examining the lines of rupture in compression parallel to the grain it appears that there does not exist any specific type, that is, one that is characteristic of all woods. Test blocks taken from different parts of the same log may show very decided differences in the manner of failure, while blocks that are much alike in the size, number, and distribution of the elements of unequal resistance may behave very similarly. The direction of rupture is, according to Jaccard, not influenced by the distribution of the medullary rays.<a id="fn07r"/><div style="display:inline-block;" class="pginternal"/> These are curved with the bundles of fibres to which they are attached. In any case the failure starts at <a id="pg019"/> the weakest points and follows the lines of least resistance. The plane of failure, as visible on radial surfaces, is horizontal, and on the tangential surface it is diagonal.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00016">SHEARING STRENGTH</h3>
<p>Whenever forces act upon a body in such a way that one portion tends to slide upon another adjacent to it the action is called a <b>shear</b>.<a id="fn08r"/><div style="display:inline-block;" class="pginternal"/> In wood this shearing action may be (1) <b>along the grain</b>, or (2) <b>across the grain</b>. A tenon breaking out its mortise is a familiar example of shear along the grain, while the shoving off of the tenon itself would be shear across the grain. The use of wood for pins or tree-nails involves resistance to shear across the grain. Another common instance of the latter is where the steel edge of the eye of an axe or hammer tends to cut off the handle. In <a href="h-1.xhtml#fig10" class="pginternal">Fig. 10</a> the action of the wooden strut tends to shear off along the grain the portion <i>AB</i> of the wooden tie rod, and it is essential that the length of this portion be great enough to guard against it. <a href="h-1.xhtml#fig11" class="pginternal">Fig. 11</a> shows characteristic failures in shear along the grain.</p>

<p>Both shearing stresses may act at the same time. Thus the weight carried by a beam tends to shear it off at right angles to the axis; this stress is equal to the resultant force acting perpendicularly at any point, and in a beam uniformly loaded and supported at either end is maximum at the points of support and zero at the centre. In addition there is a shearing force tending to move the fibres of the beam past each other in a longitudinal direction. (<a href="h-1.xhtml#fig12" class="pginternal">See Fig. 12</a>.) This longitudinal shear is maximum at the neutral plane and decreases toward the upper and lower surfaces.</p>

<p>Shearing across the grain is so closely related to compression at right angles to the grain and to hardness that there is little to be gained by making separate tests upon it. Knowledge of shear parallel to the grain is important, since wood frequently fails in that way.

<p>When external forces acting in the same plane are applied at right angles to the axis of a bar so as to cause it to bend, they occasion a shortening of the longitudinal fibres on the concave side and an elongation of those on the convex side. Within the elastic limit the relative stretching and contraction of the fibres is directly<a id="fn09r"/><div style="display:inline-block;" class="pginternal"/>] proportional to their distances from a plane <a id="pg023"/> intermediate between them—the <b>neutral plane</b>. (<i>N</i><sub><small>1</small></sub><i>P</i> in <a href="h-1.xhtml#fig15" class="pginternal">Fig. 15</a>.) Thus the fibres half-way between the neutral plane and the outer surface experience only half as much shortening or elongation as the outermost or extreme fibres. Similarly for other distances. The elements along the neutral plane experience no tension or compression in an axial direction. The line of intersection of this plane and the plane of section is known as the <b>neutral axis</b> (<i>N A</i> in <a href="h-1.xhtml#fig15" class="pginternal">Fig. 15</a>.) of the section.</p>

<p>If the bar is symmetrical and homogeneous the neutral plane is located half-way between the upper and lower surfaces, so long as the deflection does not exceed the elastic limit of the material. Owing to the fact that the tensile strength of wood is from two to nearly four times the compressive strength, it follows that at rupture the neutral plane is much nearer the convex than the concave side of the bar or beam, since the sum of all the compressive stresses on the concave portion must always equal the sum of the tensile stresses on the convex portion. The neutral plane begins to change from its central position as soon as the elastic limit has been passed. Its location at any time is very uncertain.</p>
<p>The external forces acting to bend the bar also tend to rupture it at right angles to the neutral plane by causing one transverse section to slip past another. This stress at any point is equal to the resultant perpendicular to the axis of the forces acting at this point, and is termed the <b>transverse shear</b> (or in the case of beams, <b>vertical shear</b>).</p>

<p>In addition to this there is a shearing stress, tending to move the fibres past one another in an axial direction, which is called <b>longitudinal shear</b> (or in the case of beams, <b>horizontal shear</b>). This stress must be taken into consideration in the design of timber structures. It is maximum at the neutral plane and decreases to zero at the outer elements of the section. The shorter the span of a beam in proportion to its height, the greater is the liability of failure in horizontal shear before the ultimate strength of the beam is reached.</p>
<h4 class="c1" id="pgepubid00018">Beams</h4>
<p>There are three common forms of beams, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) <b>Simple beam</b>—a bar resting upon two supports, one near each end. (<a href="h-1.xhtml#fig16" class="pginternal">See Fig. 16</a>, No. 1.)</p>
<p>(2) <b>Cantilever beam</b>—a bar resting upon one support or fulcrum, or that portion of any beam projecting out of a wall or beyond a support. (<a href="h-1.xhtml#fig16" class="pginternal">See Fig. 16</a>, No. 2.)</p>
<p>(3) <b>Continuous beam</b>—a bar resting upon more than two supports. (<a href="h-1.xhtml#fig16" class="pginternal">See Fig. 16</a>, No. 3.)</p>

<h4 class="c1" id="pgepubid00019">Stiffness of Beams</h4>
<p>The two main requirements of a beam are stiffness and strength. The formulæ for the <i>modulus of elasticity (E)</i> or measure of stiffness of a rectangular prismatic simple beam loaded at the centre and resting freely on supports at either end is:<a id="fn10r"/><div style="display:inline-block;" class="pginternal"/></p>
